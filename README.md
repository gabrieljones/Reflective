```
- None - passes straight through eg 3rd segment left or right aka opposite segment

  Never reflects backwards

## Resolve

After players rotate one of their Reflectors their emitters both fire.

If an emitted ray hits the opposing players emitter that player loses.

## Simplified
Take turns

On your turn

Choose a single reflector

Single tap to rotate clockwise one click

Double tap to rotate counter clockwise on click

Tap your emitter to emit a ray

Watch the ray bounce around the field

If it hits an emitter that player loses, emitter becomes reflector

End of turn, next players turn

### Setup
Blinks start as reflectors

Long press to become emitter

When alone tap emitters to change color
