- Steep - reflect to 1st segment right or left, two opposing segments lit up

```
- None - passes straight through eg 3rd segment left or right aka opposite segment

  Never reflects backwards

## Resolve

After players rotate one of their Reflectors their emitters both fire.

If an emitted ray hits the opposing players emitter that player loses.

## Simplified
Take turns

On your turn

Choose a single reflector

Tap once to rotate it one click

Tap your emitter to emit a ray

Watch the ray bounce around the field

If it hits an emitter that player loses

End of turn, next players turn
